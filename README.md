# DeepLearning in pytorch for the first time
Dont mind me, just playing around and learning how neural networks work and need a place to keep it.

Sentdex and https://wwwpythonprogramming.net has amazing tutorials on almost everything deep learning and machine learning. I'm going to start there and see how it goes. The eventual goal is to implement a image segmentation network in pytorch for fun. This is the first neural network I'm working with so I'll start with MNIST and work my way up. 

# Requirements
<ol>
  <li>Python, obviously</li>
  <li>CUDA from NVIDIA, https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads. I used version 10</li>
  <li> pytorch https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ </li>
</ol>
